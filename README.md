## Project Idea

Building a leetcode study session website where people can view each other's progress and code in real time and chat. 

- User can build rooms for study session
- They are given a leetcode problem that they have to solve within a given time
- People can discuss problems in chat room and look at other people's code in real time
- Viewer can turn off their view sharing if they want to
- Leetcode leaderboard of who gets most views, solves most problems, best complexity
- User gets personalized stats on which problems he did, how many people viewed him, etc.
- Adding friends
- Live notification system where you get notifications if your friend made a room
