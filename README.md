## Project Idea

Building a tag game with obstacles and proximity chat. 

- Team of 1-3 Taggers and 2-6 runners
- Whenever taggers or runners are close, they can chat among themselves
- Standard map with some obstacles
- If runner gets tagged, they follow the tagger that tagged them for the rest of the game
